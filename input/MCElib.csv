Upon single-electron reduction of Lucigenin by a radical species the subsequent form of Lucigenin presents an amplified chemiluminescence which is measurable and can be correlated to the respective amount of reactive radical species present in the system. This approach can be used to probe the natural generation of these species as well as the natural functioning of superoxide dismutase and other enzymes responsible for scavenging radicals. In addition to indicating the presence of radicals in cells, Lucigenin shows interaction with redox-active oxidoreductase enzymes. Lucigenin is shown to mediate the reduction of cytochrome C by xanthine oxidase and to increase the rate of NADPH oxidation.

in vitro: Cucurbitacin-B inhibited growth and modulated expression of cell-cycle regulators in SHSY5Y cells. At the molecular level, we found that Cucurbitacin-B inhibited AKT signaling activation through up-regulation of PTEN [1]. CuB induced apoptosis of A549 cells in a -concentration-dependent manner, as determined by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy. CuB dose-dependently inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation, with cell cycle inhibition and cyclin B1 downregulation. Apoptosis induced by CuB was shown to be associated with cytochrome c release, B-cell lymphoma 2 downregulation and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway inhibition [2]. CuB inhibited ITGA6 and ITGB4 (integrin α6 and integrin β4), which are overexpressed in breast cancer. Furthermore, CuB also induced the expression of major ITGB1and ITGB3, which are known to cause integrin-mediated cell death [3]. Cuc B treatment caused DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) without affecting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), the potential molecular target for Cuc B. Cuc B triggers ATM-activated Chk1-Cdc25C-Cdk1, which could be reversed by both ATM siRNA and Chk1 siRNA. Cuc B also triggers ATM-activated p53-14-3-3-σ pathways, which could be reversed by ATM siRNA [4].
in vivo: Efficacy of CuB was tested in vivo using two different orthotopic models of breast cancer. MDA-MB-231 and 4T-1 cells were injected orthotopically in the mammary fat pad of female athymic nude mice or BALB/c mice respectively. Our results showed that CuB administration inhibited MDA-MB-231 orthotopic tumors by 55%, and 4T-1 tumors by 40%. The 4T-1 cells represent stage IV breast cancer and form very aggressive tumors [3].",C32H46O8,O[C@H](C1)[C@@]([C@@](C)(O)C(/C=C/C(OC(C)=O)(C)C)=O)([H])[C@](C2)(C)[C@]1(C)[C@]3([H])CC=C4C(C)(C)C([C@@H](O)C[C@@]4([H])[C@]3(C)C2=O)=O,DMSO : ≥ 100 mg/mL (178.99 mM); H2O : 1 mg/mL (1.79 mM; Need ultrasonic),DMSO Solution,23114,10mM  * 50uL,https://www.medchemexpress.com/Cucurbitacin-B.html,Apoptosis; Autophagy; Cytoskeleton; Metabolic Enzyme/Protease,Cancer,No Development Reported

IC50:51.64 μg/ml(Candida albicans drug efflux pumps)[2]
In vitro: The isolated 7,4'-Di-O-methylapigenin was further investigated for its inhibitory activity on ABC drug efflux pumps in C. albicans by monitoring an increase in ciprofloxacin, assessing the level of its accumulation, in response to reserpine. There was a higher accumulation of ciprofloxacin in Candida cells in the presence of 7,4'-Di-O-methylapigenin than with reserpine. The compound 7,4'-Di-O-methylapigenine demonstrated the activity in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 value of 51.64 μg/ml. These results support those obtained from synergism assays where by the underlying synergistic antifungal mechanisms could be due to blockage of ABC efflux pumps and increasing the susceptibility of Candida to miconazole.[2]

Target: 
in vitro: Schisandrin B exhibits anti-inflammatory activity through modulation of the redox-sensitive transcription factors Nrf2 and NF-κB. SB inhibited mitogen-induced proliferation and cytokine secretion by lymphocytes [1]. Sch B can protect neuronal cells against oxidative challenge, presumably by functioning as a hormetic agent to sustain cellular redox homeostasis and mitoenergetic capacity in neuronal cells [2]. Sch B exerted significant neuroprotective effects against microglial-mediated inflammatory injury in microglia-neuron co-cultures. Sch B significantly downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, including nitrite oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 [3]. Sch B could inhibit TGF-β induced EMT of 4T1 cells and of primary human breast cancer cells [4].
in vivo: Similar anti-inflammatory effects of SB on lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion were also observed in vivo [1]. Treatment with Sch B in CsA-treated mice significantly suppressed the elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels and attenuated the histopathological changes. Additionally, Sch B also decreased renal MDA levels and increased GSH levels in CsA-treated mice [5].",C23H28O6,CC(C1)C(C)CC2=CC(OC)=C(OC)C(OC)=C2C3=C1C=C4OCOC4=C3OC,DMSO : 100 mg/mL (249.71 mM; Need ultrasonic),DMSO Solution,152354,10mM  * 50uL,https://www.medchemexpress.com/Schisandrin-B.html,Autophagy; Immunology/Inflammation; Metabolic Enzyme/Protease; NF-κB,Neurological Disease; Cancer,No Development Reported

Target: Carbonic Anhydrase 
Tioxolone is a metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase I inhibitor with a Ki of 91 nM. Tioxolone lacks sulfonamide, sulfamate, or hydroxamate functional groups that are typically found in therapeutic carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors, such as acetazolamide. Tioxolone is proposed to be a prodrug inhibitor that is cleaved via a CA II zinc-hydroxide mechanism known to catalyze the hydrolysis of esters. When tioxolone binds in the active site of CA II, it is cleaved and forms 4-mercaptobenzene-1,3-diol via the intermediate S-(2,4-thiophenyl) hydrogen thiocarbonate. The esterase cleavage product binds to the zinc active site via the thiol group and is therefore the active CA inhibitor, while the intermediate is located at the rim of the active-site cavity.

Methoxsalen is a drug used to treat psoriasis, eczema, vitiligo, and some cutaneous lymphomas in conjunction with exposing the skin to UVA light from lamps or sunlight. Methoxsalen modifies the way skin cells receive the UVA radiation, allegedly clearing up the disease. The dosage comes in 10 mg tablets, which are taken in the amount of 30 mg 75 minutes before a PUVA (psoralen + UVA) light treatment. Chemically, methoxsalen belongs to a class of organic natural molecules known asfuranocoumarins. They consist of coumarin annulated with furan.
Administration of intra peritoneal (ip) methoxsalen significantly increased nicotine's Cmax, prolonged the plasma half-life (fourfold decrease) of nicotine, and increased its area under the curve (AUC) compared with ip vehicle treatment. Methoxsalen pretreatment prolonged the duration of nicotine-induced antinociception and hypothermia (15mg/kg, po) for periods up to 6- and 24-hr postnicotine administration, respectively.

Imidazole is useful as a buffer in the pH range of 6.2-7.8 One of the applications of imidazole is in the purification of His-tagged proteins in immobilised metal affinity chromatography(IMAC). Imidazole is used to elute tagged proteins bound to Ni ions attached to the surface of beads in the chromatography column. An excess of imidazole is passed through the column, which displaces the His-tag from nickel co-ordination, freeing the His-tagged proteins. Imidazole has become an important part of many pharmaceuticals. Synthetic imidazoles are present in many fungicides and antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antihypertensive medications.

Mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of Geniposidic acid (GA) (12.5, 25, 50 mg/kg) 1 h before receiving GA against d-galactosamine (GalN) (800 mg/kg)/LPS (40 μg/kg).

GalN/LPS increased serum aminotransferase activity, serum tumor necrosis factor-α level and hepatic lipid peroxidation and decreased hepatic glutathione content [1].

In addition, GA is a potent tumor growth inhibitor when combined with the X-irradiation, though there was no significant synergetic effect on their combined antitumor activity.

In vitro: Oroxylin A suppressed the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 via downregulating MDM2 transcription in wt-p53 cancer cells [1]. Oroxylin A remarkably reduced the generation of lactate and glucose uptake under hypoxia in HepG2 cells, inhibited HIF-1α expression and its stability [2]. Oroxylin A promotes superoxide dismutase (SOD2) gene expression through SIRT3-regulated DNA-binding activity of FOXO3a and increases the activity of SOD2 by promoting SIRT3-mediated deacetylation [3]. 
In vivo: Oroxylin A inhibited the tumor growth of nude mice-inoculated MCF-7 or HCT116 cells. The expression of MDM2 protein in tumor tissue was downregulated by oroxylin A as well [1].

According to the Australian government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme website, based on data provided to the Australian Department of Health and Aging by the manufacturer, perindopril arginine and perindopril erbumine are therapeutically equivalent and may be interchanged without differences in clinical effect. However the dose prescribed to achieve the same effect will differ due to different molecular weights for the two forms.    
Perindopril is one of the most prescribed inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, has a large evidence base, which allows to use it in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary heart disease and chronic heart failure.

IC50 value:
Target: Neuroprotectant
in vitro: Disufenton sodium is more soluble than the spin trapping agent α-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) [1]. In an in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model, 250 mM of Disufenton sodium administered at the onset or up to 4 h after oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) produces a significant reduction in the increased BBB permeability caused by OGD. Furthermore, OGD produces a huge influx of tissue plasminogen activator across the BBB, which is substantially reduced by Disufenton sodium [2]. 
in vivo: Disufenton sodium reduces infarct volume in rats subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion in a dose-dependent manner. At equimolar doses (3.0 mg/kg for Disufenton sodium and 1.4 mg/kg for PBN), Disufenton sodium is more efficacious than PBN. Similar results are obtained when a recovery period of 7 days is allowed. The window of therapeutic opportunity for Disufenton sodium is 3 to 6 hours after the start of recirculation [1]. Disufenton sodium, a free radical-trapping agent, has a substantial protective effect, lessening the disability caused by an experimentally induced stroke in a primate species. Disufenton sodium treatment reduces the overall amount of brain damage by >50% of saline-treatment values, with similar levels of protection afforded to both white and gray matter [3].",C11H13NNa2O7S2,O=S(C1=C(C=CC(S(=O)(O[Na])=O)=C1)/C=[N+]([O-])/C(C)(C)C)(O[Na])=O,H2O : ≥ 50 mg/mL (131.12 mM); DMSO : 125 mg/mL (327.80 mM; Need ultrasonic),DMSO Solution,04992,10mM  * 50uL,https://www.medchemexpress.com/nxy-059.html,Immunology/Inflammation; Metabolic Enzyme/Protease; NF-κB,Neurological Disease,Phase 3

In vitro: The in vitro study of resveratrol and trans-Trimethoxyresveratrol showed rather weak cytotoxic effects on three cancer cell lines (HepG2, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231), which contradicted a previous study reporting that resveratrol inhibited MCF-7 cells with an IC50 of about 10 μM. This discrepancy might be explained by the fact that the measurements were made 24 h after drug treatment, whereas the measurements of the previous study were taken 6 days after. The fact that the cytotoxic effect of trans-Trimethoxyresveratrol was lower than that of resveratrol is surprising, because in many studies, trans-Trimethoxyresveratrol is the most active analogue of resveratrol , although resveratrol shows much stronger antioxidant effects than that of trans-Trimethoxyresveratrol.[1]
In vivo: Zebrafish embryos offer great advantage over their adults as well as other in vivo models because of the external development and optical transparency during their first few days, making them invaluable in the inspection of developmental processes. These unique advantages can even be made more useful when specific cell types are labeled with fluorescent probes. Zebrafish embryo in vivo, suggests that trans-Trimethoxyresveratrol has both more potent antiangiogenic activity and more importantly, stronger specific cytotoxic effects on endothelial cells than does resveratrol.[1]",C17H18O3,COC1=CC=C(/C=C/C2=CC(OC)=CC(OC)=C2)C=C1,DMSO : ≥ 50 mg/mL (184.97 mM); H2O : < 0.1 mg/mL (insoluble),DMSO Solution,26546,10mM  * 50uL,https://www.medchemexpress.com/trans-Trimethoxyresveratrol.html,Immunology/Inflammation; Metabolic Enzyme/Protease; NF-κB,Inflammation/Immunology; Cancer,No Development Reported

Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle, and is usually produced at a fairly constant rate by the body (depending on muscle mass). Creatine is synthesized primarily in the liver from the methylation of glycocyamine (guanidino acetate, synthesized in the kidney from the amino acids arginine and glycine) by S-adenosyl methionine. It is then transported through blood to the other organs, muscle, and brain, where, through phosphorylation, it becomes the high-energy compound phosphocreatine. During the reaction, creatine and phosphocreatine are catalyzed by creatine kinase, and a spontaneous conversion to creatinine may occur [1]. Creatinine levels in blood and urine may be used to calculate the creatinine clearance (CrCl), which reflects the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), an important clinical index of renal function [2].

Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is the direct precursor of redox enzyme cofactors flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are essential for multiple cell physiology [1]. Urinary excretion of riboflavin contributes to one-half of the overall removal of riboflavin from plasma. No sex differences were observed for any of the pharmacokinetic variables (P > 0.05) [2]. Riboflavin, similar to other vitamins of the B complex, presents anti-inflammatory activity but its full characterization has not yet been carried out. Riboflavin (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg, i.p.), administered immediately and 2 h after the injection of carrageenan, induced antiedema and antinociceptive effects. The antinociceptive effect was not inhibited by the pretreatment with cadmium sulfate (1 mg/kg), an inhibitor of flavokinase. Riboflavin (50 or 100 mg/kg, i.p., 0 and 2 h) also inhibited the fever induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. Riboflavin is a safe drug, is approved for clinical use and exacerbates the antinociceptive effect of morphine, may warrant clinical trials to assess its potential in the treatment of different painful or inflammatory conditions [3].",C17H20N4O6,O[C@H]([C@H](O)[C@H](O)CO)CN1C(C=C(C)C(C)=C2)=C2N=C(C(N3)=O)C1=NC3=O,DMSO : 17.86 mg/mL (47.45 mM; ultrasonic and warming and heat to 60°C); H2O : 14.29 mg/mL (37.97 mM; ultrasonic and adjust pH to 8 with NaOH),DMSO Solution,114155,10mM  * 50uL,https://www.medchemexpress.com/riboflavin.html,Anti-infection; Metabolic Enzyme/Protease,Cancer,Launched

IC50 value: HDM2 ubiquitin ligase
Target: 
in vitro: JNJ 26854165 is a novel tryptamine derivative which activates p53 and acts as a HDM2 ubiquitin ligase antagonist. JNJ 26854165 inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in leukemia cell lines with IC50 values of 0.24, 0.33, 0.32 and 0.44 μM at 72 hours for OCI-AML-3, MOLM-13, NALM-6 and REH cells, respectively. In addition, JNJ 26854165 accelerates proteasome-mediated degradation of p21 and antagonizes the transcriptional induction of p21 by p53. It also induces S-phase delay and upregulates E2F1 expression in p53 mutant cells, resulting in preferential apoptosis of S-phase cells. JNJ 26854165 is an oral Mdm2 inhibitor which can inhibit the interaction of Mdm2-p53 complex with the proteasome and increase p53 levels by binding to RING domain of Mdm2. A recent study shows that JNJ 26854165 inhibits clonogenic survival in four human cancer cell lines: H460, A549, p53-WT-HCT116, and p53-null-HCT116.
in vivo:JNJ 26854165 leads to significant differences in EFS distribution in 17 of the 36 (47%) evaluable solid tumor xenografts and in 5 of 7 (71%) of the evaluable ALL xenografts using a dose of 20 mg/kg administered via oral gavage daily for 5 days, repeated for 6 weeks.

Target: Estrogen Receptor
Ethynyl Estradiol (17α-Ethynylestradiol;Ethynylestradiol), also sometimes written as ethinylestradiol, ethynyl estradiol, or ethinyl estradiol, is a derivative of 17β-estradiol (E2), the major endogenous estrogen in humans. 
Ethynyl Estradiol (17α-Ethynylestradiol;Ethynylestradiol) is an orally bioactive estrogen used in many formulations of combined oral contraceptive pills. It is one of the most commonly used medications for this purpose. 
Transdermal ethinyl estradiol carries a greater risk of clot formation and venous thromboembolism than 17 beta estradiol, which some have theorized to be related to different amounts of hepatic metabolism after absorption. 
The same contraindications and precautions apply for EE as with other estrogen medications.
Ethynyl Estradiol was a preparation of Ethynyl Estradiol alone that was used for the management of menopausal symptoms and female hypogonadism. 
Ethynyl Estradiol (17α-Ethynylestradiol;Ethynylestradiol) is released into the environment as a xenoestrogen from the urine and feces of people who take it as a medication. 
The major concern with unopposed estrogen is of endometrial cancer. As such, the medication is generally prescribed with progesterone in the setting of birth control. 
The first orally active semisynthetic steroidal estrogen, Ethynyl Estradiol, the 17α-ethynyl analog of E2, was synthesized in 1938 by Hans Herloff Inhoffen and Walter Hohlweg at Schering AG in Berlin.",C20H24O2,OC1=CC=C2C(CC[C@]3([H])[C@]2([H])CC[C@@]4(C)[C@@]3([H])CC[C@]4(C#C)O)=C1,DMSO : 250 mg/mL (843.45 mM; Need ultrasonic); H2O : 1 mg/mL (3.37 mM; ultrasonic and warming and heat to 80°C),DMSO Solution,114383,10mM  * 50uL,https://www.medchemexpress.com/Ethynyl-Estradiol.html,Metabolic Enzyme/Protease; Others,Endocrinology; Cancer,Launched

Target: angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
Benazepril hydrochloride is a medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure. Upon cleavage of its ester group by the liver, benazepril hydrochloride is converted into its active form benazeprilat, a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor [1].
Animals were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham STNx group (control), STNx group, morning benazepril hydrochloride group (MB) and evening benazepril hydrochloride group (EB).Benazepril hydrochloride was intragastrically administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day at 07:00 and 19:00 in the MB group and EB group respectively for 12 weeks. All the animals were synchronized to the light:dark cycle of 12:12 for 12 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), 24-h urinary protein excretion and renal function were measured at 11 weeks. Blood samples and kidneys were collected every 4 h throughout a day to detect the expression pattern of renin activity (RA), angiotensin II (AngII) and aldosterone (Ald) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and the mRNA expression profile of clock genes (bmal1, dbp and per2) by real-time PCR at 12 weeks. Our results showed that no significant differences were noted in the SBP, 24-h urine protein excretion and renal function between the MB and EB groups. There were no significant differences in average Ald and RA content of a day between the MB group and EB group. The expression peak of bmal1 mRNA was phase-delayed by 4 to 8 h, and the diurnal variation of per2 and dbp mRNA diminished in the MB and EB groups compared with the control and STNx groups. It was concluded when the similar SBP reduction, RAAS inhibition and clock gene profile were achieved with optimal dose of benazepril hydrochloride, morning versus evening dosing of benazepril hydrochloride has the same renoprotection effects [2].

IC50 value:
Target: angiogenesis stimulator
in vitro: Ft1 increases translocalization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) from cytoplasm to nuclei, where it binds to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter, increasing the expression of VEGF mRNA and the subsequent secretion of the growth factor. Ft1 induces the activation of PI3K/AKT and Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways [1]. Among the saponins examined, Ft1 was the most potent procoagulant and induced dose-dependent platelet aggregation. Ft1 reduced plasma coagulation indexes, decreased tail bleeding time and increased thrombogenesis. Moreover, it potentiated ADP-induced platelet aggregation and increased cytosolic Ca(2+) accumulation, effects that were attenuated by clopidogrel. Ft1 binds to platelet P2Y12 receptors. The increase in intracellular Ca(2+) evoked by Ft1 in HEK293 cells overexpressing P2Y12  receptors could be blocked by ticagrelor [2]. Ft1 caused endothelium-dependent relaxations, which were abolished by l-NAME (inhibitor of nitric oxide synthases) and ODQ (inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase). Ft1 increased the cGMP level in rat mesenteric arteries. GR and ER  were present in the endothelial layer and their antagonism by RU486 and PHTPP, respectively, inhibited Ft1-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations and phosphorylations of eNOS, Akt and ERK1/2 [3].  Ft1 showed the best inhibitory effect on cell proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells with IC50 of 45μM. Ft1 not only arrested the cell cycle at S, G2/M stages, but also promoted cell apoptosis. Ft1 up-regulated the protein expressions of cleaved caspase 3, phospho-p53, p21, and cyclin B1, but down-regulated that of Bcl-2. Moreover, Ft1 enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK [4].

Doxapram is a respiratory stimulant. Doxapram (15-150 microM) also evoked 3H overflow in a concentration dependent manner, and doxapram-evoked release was inhibited by the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (5 microM). Analysis of released tritiated compounds suggested that doxapram preferentially stimulated the release of dopamine. Our results indicate that the mechanism of action of doxapram shares similarities with that of hypoxia in the carotid body [1]. Doxapram (1-100 microM) caused rapid, reversible and dose-dependent inhibitions of K+ currents recorded in type I cells (IC50 approximately 13 microM). doxapram was also seen to directly inhibit Ca(2+)-independent K+ currents. Doxapram was a more potent inhibitor of the Ca(2+)-activated K+ currents recorded under control conditions. Doxapram (10 microM) was without effect on L-type Ca2+ channel currents recorded under conditions where K+ channel activity was minimized and was also without significant effect on K+ currents recorded in the neuronal cell line NG-108 15, suggesting a selective effect on carotid body type I cells. The effects of doxapram on type I cells show similarities to those of the physiological stimuli of the carotid body, suggesting that doxapram may share a similar mechanism of action in stimulating the intact organ [2].

in vitro: DM 232 and DM 235 are novel antiamnesic compounds structurally related to ampakines.

Target: nAChR
Decamethonium (Syncurine) is a depolarizing muscle relaxant or neuromuscular blocking agent, and is used in anesthesia to induce paralysis. Decamethonium, which has a short action time, is similar to acetylcholine and acts as a partial agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. In the motor endplate, it causes depolarization, preventing further effects to the normal release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal, and therefore preventing the neural stimulus from affecting the muscle. In the process of binding, decamethonium actually activates (depolarizes) the motor endplate, but since the decamethonium itself is not degraded, the membrane remains depolarized and unresponsive to normal acetylcholine release [1].

IC50 Value:  
Target: Calcium Channel
Gabapentin enacarbil is an actively transported prodrug of gabapentin that provides sustained dose-proportional exposure to gabapentin and predictable bioavailability.
in vitro: The prodrug (XP-13512) demonstrated active apical to basolateral transport across Caco-2 cell monolayers and pH-dependent passive permeability across artificial membranes. XP13512 inhibited uptake of (14)C-lactate by human embryonic kidney cells expressing monocarboxylate transporter type-1, and direct uptake of prodrug by these cells was confirmed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. XP13512 inhibited uptake of (3)H-biotin into Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) [1].
in vivo:  In 4 studies of healthy volunteers (136 subjects total), the pharmacokinetics of XP13512 immediate- and extended-release formulations were compared with those of oral gabapentin. XP13512 immediate-release (up to 2800 mg single dose and 2100 mg twice daily) was well absorbed (>68%, based on urinary recovery of gabapentin), converted rapidly to gabapentin, and provided dose-proportional exposure, whereas absorption of oral gabapentin declined with increasing doses to <27% at 1200 mg. Compared with 600 mg gabapentin, an equimolar XP13512 extended-release dose provided extended gabapentin exposure (time to maximum concentration, 8.4 vs 2.7 hours) and superior bioavailability (74.5% vs 36.6%) [2].
Toxicity: Gabapentin's most common side effects in adult patients include dizziness, fatigue, weight gain, drowsiness, and peripheral edema (swelling of extremities).",C16H27NO6,O=C(O)CC1(CNC(OC(OC(C(C)C)=O)C)=O)CCCCC1,DMSO : ≥ 100 mg/mL (303.59 mM); Ethanol : 100 mg/mL (303.59 mM; Need ultrasonic),DMSO Solution,111624,10mM  * 50uL,https://www.medchemexpress.com/Gabapentin-enacarbil.html,Membrane Transporter/Ion Channel; Neuronal Signaling,Neurological Disease,Launched

in vivo: Treatment with docetaxel alone at the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) showed an apparent antitumor activity to an intrinsically resistant HCT-15 tumor xenograft, and MS-209 additionally potentiated the antitumor activity of docetaxel. Against a MCF-7/ADM tumor xenograft expressing larger amounts of P-gp, docetaxel alone at the MTD showed no antitumor activity, whereas the MTD of docetaxel combined with MS-209 greatly reduced MCF-7/ADM tumor growth [1].

in vitro: Efonidipine and nifedipine, but not other examined CCBs, also increased the N(6), 2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (dbcAMP)-induced StAR mRNA, which reflects the action of adrenocorticotropic hormone, and efonidipine and R(-)-efonidipine enhanced the dbcAMP-induced DHEA-S production in NCI-H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cells [1]. I(Ca(T)) was blocked mainly by a tonic manner by nifedipine, by a use-dependent manner by mibefradil, and by a combination of both manners by efonidipine. IC50s of these Ca2+ channel antagonists to I(Ca(T)) and L-type Ca2+ channel current (I(Ca(L))) were 1.2 micromol/l and 0.14 nmol/l for nifedipine; 0.87 and 1.4 micromol/l for mibefradil, and 0.35 micromol/l and 1.8 nmol/l for efonidipine, respectively [4].
in vivo: Twenty hypertensive patients on chronic hemodialysis were given efonidipine 20-60 mg twice daily and amlodipine 2.5-7.5 mg once daily for 12 weeks each in a random crossover manner. The average blood pressure was comparable between the efonidipine and amlodipine periods (151 + or - 15/77 + or - 8 versus 153 + or - 15/76 + or - 8 mmHg). The pulse rate did not change significantly during the administration periods [2].  In the UM-X7.1 group, EFO treatment significantly attenuated the decrease of LVEF without affecting blood pressure compared with the vehicle group. EFO treatment decreased heart rate (by approximately 10%) in both groups [3].",C36H45ClN3O8P,CC1=C(P2(OCC(C)(C)CO2)=O)C(C3=CC([N+]([O-])=O)=CC=C3)C(C(OCCN(C4=CC=CC=C4)CC5=CC=CC=C5)=O)=C(C)N1.[H]Cl.CCO,DMSO : 125 mg/mL (175.03 mM; Need ultrasonic); H2O : < 0.1 mg/mL (ultrasonic;warming;heat to 60°C) (insoluble),DMSO Solution,38352,10mM  * 50uL,https://www.medchemexpress.com/Efonidipine-hydrochloride-monoethanolate.html,Membrane Transporter/Ion Channel; Neuronal Signaling,Cardiovascular Disease,Launched

Tolbutamide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Tolbutamide act by stimulating β cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Tolbutamide belongs to a class of medications called sulfonylureas. Tolbutamide inhibits both the basal and the cyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase activities and the IC50 of Tolbutamide is 4 mM. Similar Tolbutamide concentrations are required for half maximal inhibition of in vitro lipolysis induced by hormones (norepinephrine and ACTH) or by dibutyryl cyclic AMP plus theophylline. Tolbutamide also inhibits both soluble and membrane-bound protein kinase from canine heart. The Tolbutamide inhibition of adipose tissue cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase is one possible explanation for the antilipolytic effects of this drug [1]. Tolbutamide inhibits C6-glioma cell proliferation by increasing Cx43, which correlates with a reduction in pRb phosphorylation due to the up-regulation of the Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27 [2].

IC50 value:
Target: 
in vitro: Azimilide dihydrochloride blocked HERG channels at 0.1 and 1 Hz with IC50s of 1.4 microM and 5.2 microM respectively. Azimilide dihydrochloride blockade of HERG channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes and I(Kr) in mouse AT-1 cells was decreased under conditions of high [K+]e, whereas block of slowly activating I(Ks) channels was not affected by changes in [K+]e [1]. Azimilide dihydrochloride suppressed the following currents (Kd in parenthesis): IKr (< 1 microM at -20 mV), IKs (1.8 microM at +30 mV), L-type Ca current (17.8 microM at +10 mV), and Na current (19 microM at -40 mV). Azimilide dihydrochloride was a weak blocker of the transient outward and inward rectifier currents (Kd > or = 50 microM at +50 and -140 mV, respectively). Azimilide dihydrochloride blocked IKr, IKs, and INa in a use-dependent manner. Furthermore, azimilide reduced a slowly inactivating component of Na current that might be important for maintaining the action potential plateau in canine ventricular myocytes [2]. In guinea pig ventricular myocytes, Azimilide (0.3-3 microM) dihydrochloride significantly prolonged action potential duration (APD) at 1 Hz. At 3 Hz, Azimilide (0.3-1 microM) dihydrochloride increased APD only slightly, and at 10 microM decreased APD and the plateau potential. Azimilide dihydrochloride potently blocked the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier, IKr (IC50 0.4 microM), and inhibited IKs (IC50 3 microM) with nearly 10-fold less potency [3].
in vivo: Azimilide (10 mg/kg intravenously, i.v.) dihydrochloride reduced (p < 0.05) the incidence (8 of 12) of PES-induced ventricular tachycardia (VT). The cycle length of induced VT was not prolonged by Azimilide (0.245 +/- 0.046 s predrug vs. 0.301 +/- 0.060 s postdrug) dihydrochloride.

Decreased pigmentation in the desonide-treated axillae was associated with recovery of disruption at the basal membrane. Desonide showed depigmenting properties in women with axillary hyperpigmentation [2].

IC50 value:
Target: GPR44 antagonist
in vitro: AZD1981 produced a concentration-dependent displacement of the [3H]PGD2-specific binding with a mean pIC50 of 8.4 ± 0.1 (n = 25, geometric mean IC50 of 4 nM). AZD1981 had no significant affinity towards recombinant human DP1 receptors with only a mean 27% (range 14–50%; n = 4) displacement of [3H]PGD2-specific binding observed at the highest concentration tested (10 μM). Compared with the binding potency for DP2, AZD1981 showed 10-fold selectivity over rat aldose reductase and 1700-fold selectivity over rat steroid 5α-reductase.In eosinophils, a single concentration of 1 μM, AZD1981 caused a large (20-fold) rightward parallel shift in the 15R-methyl PGD2 E/[A] curve with no evidence of a decrease in the maximal response. The effect of AZD1981 was therefore investigated using a single sub-maximal concentration of agonist (1 μM). AZD1981 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of eosinophil migration with a pIC50 value of 7.6 ± 0.1 (n = 4) [1].
in vivo: Using the previously described guinea pig hind limb model , 10 nM AZD1981 significantly inhibited DK-PGD2-induced eosinophil mobilization by approximately 50%, and the response was completely inhibited with 100 nM AZD1981 [1]. 
in vivo: AZD1981 exhibited good cross-species binding activity against mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit and dog DP2 . Evaluation in mouse, rat or rabbit cell systems was not possible as they did not respond to DP2 agonists. Agonist responses were seen in guinea pig and dog, and AZD1981 blocked DP2 -mediated eosinophil shape change. Such responses were more robust in the guinea pig, where AZD1981 also blocked DP2 -dependent eosinophil emigration from bone marrow [1]. There was no beneficial clinical effect of AZD1981, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, in patients with moderate to severe COPD. AZD1981 was well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified [3].",C19H17ClN2O3S,O=C(O)CN1C(C)=C(SC2=CC=C(Cl)C=C2)C3=C1C=CC=C3NC(C)=O,DMSO : ≥ 31 mg/mL (79.72 mM),DMSO Solution,16572,10mM  * 50uL,https://www.medchemexpress.com/AZD1981.html,GPCR/G Protein; Immunology/Inflammation,Inflammation/Immunology; Endocrinology,Phase 2
